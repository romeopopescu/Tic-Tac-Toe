# Tic-Tac-Toe

Hello, I built this Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java because I wanted to get to know how a Tic-Tac-Toe game works, to improve my Java programming skills and to be a better overall programmer.
I learned how to put in practice the skills that I have and make a project from scratch using my imagination and logic.

## Overview

The game allows two players to play the game on a 3x3 grid by placing the X or 0 in different places, and checking if there is a win or a draw. 

## Usage
