# Tic-Tac-Toe

  Hello, I built this Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java because I wanted to get to know how a Tic-Tac-Toe game works, to improve my Java programming skills and to be a better overall programmer.
I learned how to put in practice the skills that I have and make a project from scratch using my imagination and logic.

## Overview

  The game allows two players to play the game on a 3x3 grid by placing the X or 0 in different places, and checking if there is a win or a draw. 

## Usage

  The game is played in the console. When running the project you will get this:
  ![table x](https://github.com/romeopopescu/Tic-Tac-Toe/assets/108995102/9b84ccde-3f82-4417-9f87-24ef9f633a66)

  The player needs to write the number of the box he wants to place his X or 0. After the player makes his choice, the table will be printed again and the other player is needed to write his
  next move.

  At the end, depending on how the game went, a message will be displayed with the result of the match.
